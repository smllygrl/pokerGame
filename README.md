# The Poker Game 

A Java based application which takes in a user string of a two player hands

eg. AH 9S 4D TD 8S 4H JS 3C TC 8D

- Where the first char denotes the value

- And the second denotes the suit

- And each player had 5 cards each

### Project

This project was the first application I built in Java.

Several concepts in Java were consolidated in this project, such as polymorphism, inheritance, and interfaces.

Some work is still required for this project to be at a standard I am comfortable with such as...

- Proper implementation of interfaces

- Exception handling

- Making it a bit DRY-er (Don't repeat yourself)

- JUnit tests
